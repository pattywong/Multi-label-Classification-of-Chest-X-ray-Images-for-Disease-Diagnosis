# Multi-label Classification of Chest X-ray Images for Common Thoracic Diseases
This is an experimental comparison of methods for multi-label classification of chest x-ray images for 5 pathologies, namely Cardiomegaly, Lung Opacity, Atelectasis, Edema and Pleural Effusion. The experiments conducted to provide better insight into different approaches and their applications to multi-label classification using [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) dataset. The model is based on Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, [DenseNet121](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993).
